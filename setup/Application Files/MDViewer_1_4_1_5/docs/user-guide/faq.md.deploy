## üß≠ **Navigation Features**

### **Q: How does the smart navigation work?**
A: MDViewer automatically:
- Finds index files (`index.md`, `readme.md`) in subdirectories
- Creates navigation headers with local file menus
- Shows related files in the footer
- Processes all internal markdown links for seamless navigation

### **Q: Why are some directory links not clickable?**
A: Directory links are only clickable when:
- The directory contains at least one markdown file
- MDViewer can find an appropriate target file (index, readme, or first available .md file)
- The target file actually exists

### **Q: Can I customize the navigation behavior?**
A: Currently navigation is automatic, but you can:
- Create `index.md` files in directories for preferred entry points
- Use `readme.md` as fallback index files
- Organize files alphabetically for predictable navigation

## üìÑ **Export Features**

### **Q: PDF export isn't working. What should I do?**
A: Try these solutions:
1. **Wait longer**: PDF export downloads Chromium on first use (may take 2-3 minutes)
2. **Check internet**: Chromium download requires internet connection
3. **Run as admin**: Try running MDViewer as administrator
4. **Antivirus**: Temporarily disable antivirus that might block Chromium download

### **Q: Word export fails with "Pandoc not found" error**
A: Install Pandoc manually:
1. Visit [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
2. Download and install Pandoc for Windows
3. Restart MDViewer and try Word export again
4. Alternative: Use PDF export which works without additional software

### **Q: Where are exported files saved?**
A: Exports are saved in the same directory as the source markdown file:
- PDF: `filename.pdf`
- Word: `filename.docx`
